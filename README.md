# regex-calculator

## Backstory
This small project was made back in the summer of 2021, where a "friend" of mine had the curtesy to tell me that making a calculator was a greate way to learn a language. What he forgot to mention was to not use regular expressions to do so. I guess I did learn a language trying to use regex, this was not Python nor regular expressions, but Stackoverflow.

## Functionality
This is a calculator run only in a command line. Running the calculator asks the user for a math expression, and then it return the result. Supported operations are `-`, `+`, `/`, `*` and parenthesis `(exp)`.

### Example
```console
$ python3 calculator.py
start by giving me a math expression to solve. You can use [+] [-] [/] [*] [(exp)].
:(4/(5*6))*(5/9)+5*(5-6)
(4/(5*6))*(5/9)+5*(5-6) = -4.925925925925926
```
